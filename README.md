How It Works

1. A user posts a question, idea, or discussion topic.


2. Other members reply with their opinions, answers, or resources.


3. The conversation grows as more members contribute, often with quoting or tagging features to address specific points.


4. The thread stays online for others to find later, building a knowledge base.
